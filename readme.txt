== Description ==
A simple WordPress Gutenberg editor plugin that provides a method of creating conditional content dependent on client-side variables.

Developers run the following to get started:
- composer install
- yarn install

Then, to run the PHP unit tests once, run (from the project's root):
- ./vendor/bin/phpunit --config phpunit.xml

Then, to build the JavaScript code, run:
- yarn run build

Or, if you want the JavaScript to automatically build when files are modified:
- yarn run dev
